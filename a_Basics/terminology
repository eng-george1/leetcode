Sort Algorithms 

Quick Sort     O(Logn)   O(nLogn)  O(nLogn) O(n^2) not stable, select pivot and have right and left 
Merge sort     O(nLogn)  O(nLogn)  O(nLogn) o(n) stable divided into two array and sort each one
Bubble sort    O(n)      o(n^2)    o(n^2)   O(1) stable swap until largest element at the end and repeat
Insertion sort O(n)      o(n^2)    o(n^2)   O(1) stable swap but with back 
Selection sort O(n^2)    o(n^2)    o(n^2)   O(1) stable like bubble except swap one time the max/min with last/first
